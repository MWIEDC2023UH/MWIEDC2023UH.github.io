        recommendations</h2>
    <p><em>In case you have the time to explore a little more of Houston,
            here are a few ideas from each of us:</em></p>
    <h4 id="elaine"><a href="https://uh.edu/~emliu/">Elaine</a></h4>
    <p>This is where I would take out-of-town guests, from closest to
        farthest:</p>
    <p>El Tiempo (multiple locations). This is where Tex-Mex fajita was
        invented (<a
            href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/article/Popular-Tex-Mex-eatery-roots-itself-where-Ninfa-s-4327506.php">see
            the full story here</a>). Xochi (in downtown) for Mex-Mex (as opposed to
        Tex-Mex) restaurant.</p>
    <p>If you want to see Houston downtown skyline, check out <a href="https://www.posthtx.com/">Post</a> It’s an old
        post office turned
        into food hall with a nice rooftop.</p>
    <p>Visit Rothko Chapel and Menil Museum during the day.</p>
    <p>For Sunday afternoon hangout with outdoor space, Under the Radar
        Brewery (low-key, outdoor patio, craft beer). Grabbing cocktails at
        night, Anvil or Julip (James Beard Award winning bar)</p>
    <p>For BBQ, Truth BBQ (expect a long wait). If it’s too crowded,
        Killen’s Height is a nearby Southern restaurant for chicken fried
        chicken/steak and bbq (same as Killen’s bbq, which is 30 min drive from
        UH).</p>
    <p>Visit <a href="https://thehoustonfarmersmarket.com/">Houston Farmer’s
            Market</a> during the day. It’s not your typical farmer’s market. It’s
        an open-air Mexican-style market. Full of dried chilies, corns, beans,
        traditional herbal medicine and tropical fruits/vegetables that you may
        not recognize. Make a quick stop for snacks at the taco truck at the end
        of the parking lot. Be sure to check out El Bollilo Mexican Bakery,
        which is opposite of the market.</p>
    <p>If you are adventurous and have a car, all these restaurants are in
        the same part of town (30 min drive from UH): Nam Giao (James Beard
        Award-Winning Vietnamese restaurant), Peking Expression (call to reserve
        a duck in advance, best Peking duck in town), Malubianbian (AYCE Chinese
        hotpot), Lucy’s Ethiopian, Reza Persian Grill, Saffron Kabab
        (Afghan).</p>
    <h4 id="willa"><a href="https://willafriedman.com/">Willa</a> </h4>
    <p>For an evening of food and drinks, check out EaDo. Start with coffee
        and snacks at Koffeteria; then for beers in patios, try Truckyard
        (hipster-carnival patio) or 8th Wonder (giant patio) or True Anomaly
        (NASA-enthusiast patio). For nearby dinner try Indianola (nicer), Huynh
        (Vietnamese), or Rodeo Goat (burgers, including multiple veg patties).
        All of these are within a few blocks of each other.</p>
    <p>Other great restaurants in order of proximity: Lucille's (fried green
        tomatoes and a patio), Toasted Coconut (everything), Jun Bykin (Houston
        Top Chef star!), Lucy's Ethiopian (veg combo), Shiv Sagar (dosas and
        chaat). Ask me if you need any vegetarian recommendations!</p>

    <p>Bluebonnet watching in Texas is like maple leaf peeping in the
        Northeast. You are lucky because they are in bloom during our
        conference. Here are a few places to see them.</p>

    </p>
    <h4 id="gergely"><a href="https://uh.edu/~gujhelyi/">Gergely</a></h4>
    <p>Check out an installation, museum or show curated by the <a href="https://orangeshow.org/">Orange Show</a> (the
        <a href="https://www.thehoustonartcarparade.com/">Art Car Parade</a> is a
        highlight, but you’d have to come back for it in a couple of weeks).</p>
    <p>I can’t believe no one else has said this: go out to <a href="https://spacecenter.org/">NASA</a>. It’s worth it.
